Just an hour on the road and you will arrive at the tribal village. Here, you can interact with the local people to learn about their way of life. Also, visit the small temple at the end of the village, and take blessings for your journey ahead.\r\nHere onwards, you have a steep descend, and you will also have to cross a small stream over a wooden bridge. After you cross the stream, a climb will take you to the small village called Surai. The overnight stay will be in camps in the village.\r\n '}, 'lngDef': './info/textInfoAllProducts/Trek/Jalsu_Pass_terk/lngDef', 'ShortDef': u'The trek to Jalsu Pass is a great optionfor family ad friend.The 8-km long hike through serene meadows on the third day will become an unforgettable memory. You will enjoy every second of the uphill trek to Yaragot. From Yaragot, the base of the Jalsu Pass is only a 3-hour walk; hence, you will have plenty of time here to acclimatise to the high altitude. As you arrive at the summit of Jalsa Pass on the fifth day, you will be left awestruck by the natural views.The monsoon rain makes the trek manifolds difficult; therefore, it is better to avoid trekking during that period.   The Himalayas, passing through Himachal Pradesh, make the state an ideal destination for myriad adventure sports, and one such sport is trekking. This is perhaps the best way to come face to face with snow-clad mountain peaks and explore the natural bounties of this state. The Jalsu Pass Trek in Himachal Pradesh is a 7-day long venture, which takes you to the summit of a high-altitude pass. It also allows you to come across the diverse flora and fauna of the region.   Beginning from the town of Chamba, you first drive to Chhatrari Village, to pay homage at Shakti Devi Temple. From here, you proceed to Holi village, ending the day in the village of Deol. The second day of the Jalsu Pass trekking will take you to the tribal village of Nayagran, leaving you fascinated with the life of these tribal people. You will be amazed to see how cut off these people are from the modern world. This day ends with camping in Surai Village.The downhill trek beginning from here takes you to Parai by the end of the day. The sixth day concludes with you reaching the artists\u2019 village of Andretta, after passing Uttarall. In the village, you have enough time to explore its heritage and meet the various artists living here. From here, you drive to Dharamshala, where this amazing adventure finishes, leaving you with pleasant memories for life.The two highlights of this trek are the villages you visit and the vistas you capture on the trail. The trek is graded moderate; hence, it demands some more than average physical fitness.   The best time to go for this expedition is from April to November.
