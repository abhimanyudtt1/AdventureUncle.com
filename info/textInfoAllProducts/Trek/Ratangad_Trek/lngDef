As the name suggest, Ratangad is a ‘jewel’ of a fort situated atop a hill overlooking the Bhandardara region. The caves up there can shelter dozens of trekkers at a time. Kalsubai peak and the Konkan-Kada are visible from here, along with a number of waterfalls! The view of lakes from atop are mesmerizing.

During this time, the rare purple-blue Karvi flowers are in bloom in Ratangad after a period of eight years. The special yellow Sonki has enveloped the region forming a sight to behold. There cannot be a more apt time to trek in Ratangad to indulge the nature-enthusiast in you.
Come, bask in the glory of the rare sight of the flower bed!
